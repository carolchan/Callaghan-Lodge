Hi Kim\
11-08-03 12:12 PM\
Sorry, I forgot to login earlier. I sent an email not long ago. Did you receive it?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-03 12:13 PM \
nope... i try "send /receive"\
11-08-03 12:14 PM\
got it\
Carol Chan 11-08-03 12:14 PM \
Awesome. Let me know if you have any questions\
11-08-03 12:14 PM\
or if u are free to chat?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-03 12:15 PM \
Carol I'm definitely thinking it's time to start working together in an office type setting\
11-08-03 12:15 PM\
numerous questions are popping up and i don't think skype will suffice to get me through all these learing curves\
Carol Chan 11-08-03 12:16 PM \
What kind of questions?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-03 12:16 PM \
photoshop and then the wordpress plunking in steps\
Carol Chan 11-08-03 12:16 PM \
All lot of it involves playing around with the Wordpress\
11-08-03 12:17 PM\
What part of photoshop are you having troubles?\
11-08-03 12:17 PM\
I think it's a matter of understanding the it\
Kim Ebers 11-08-03 12:17 PM \
I'm a little frustrated playing around with it on my own - i don't do well with this stuff with out having someone to ask\
Carol Chan 11-08-03 12:17 PM \
We can meet up if you like once a week, but do consider that i'm under a tight timeline in getting the website set up as well.\
11-08-03 12:18 PM\
ok let's chat live?\
11-08-03 12:18 PM\
can i call you?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-03 12:18 PM \
yep, it wouldn't so much be a meeting format, but moreso just working together\

Hi Kim\
11-08-03 3:56 PM\
I noticed you made note of the map and current conditions. I may have to ask keith about it because it works whenever i place the codes in. But whenever someone put new information below it, it changes the entirety of the maps\
Kim Ebers 11-08-03 3:56 PM \
ok\
11-08-03 3:57 PM\
did that happen to the snow conditions page too?\
Carol Chan 11-08-03 3:58 PM \
yep\
11-08-03 3:58 PM\
I'm gonna see if there's a plugin first\
11-08-03 3:58 PM\
if not, i'll need to email Keith\
Kim Ebers 11-08-03 3:58 PM \
also, could we bump up tomorrowsmtg to 9am\
Carol Chan 11-08-03 3:58 PM \
I guess wordpress doesn't accept iframe\
Kim Ebers 11-08-03 3:58 PM \
i already have some new questions\
Carol Chan 11-08-03 3:58 PM \
sounds good\
Kim Ebers 11-08-03 3:59 PM \

Hi Kim\
11-08-04 11:13 AM\
Do you have a google analytics account set up?\
11-08-04 11:13 AM\
I need the UA code\
11-08-04 11:13 AM\
and i can't find it in the key accounts word document that you and brad sent me in june with all the username and password for the various accounts.\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:14 AM \
i don't think we do - would it be the same account as our general google sign-in?\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:14 AM \
i used that to sign in: reservations@callaghancountry.com?\
11-08-04 11:15 AM\
what is the gmail/google email account?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:15 AM \
that's the sign-in email\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:15 AM \
yes, i tried that with callaghan1\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:15 AM \
the pw is Callaghan9\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:15 AM \
password\
11-08-04 11:15 AM\
sorry, callaghan9\
11-08-04 11:16 AM\
and it seems to not allow it.\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:16 AM \
let me try something here\
11-08-04 11:18 AM\
it worked fine for me\
11-08-04 11:18 AM\
maybe it's case sensitive?\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:18 AM \
https://www.google.com/accounts/AuthSubRequest?next=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.callaghancountry.com%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-admin%2Foptions-general.php%3Fpage%3Dgoogle-analytics-for-wordpress&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fanalytics%2Ffeeds%2F&secure=0&session=1&hd=default\
11-08-04 11:18 AM\
I tried that. It's fine logging in\
11-08-04 11:18 AM\
but it's denying the access\
11-08-04 11:18 AM\
see the above URL link\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:19 AM \
it's giving me the option to grant or deny access\

11-08-04 11:23 AM\
brought me to the above link\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:23 AM \
yes, it says on my screen: Unfortunately, an error occurred while connecting to Google, please try again\
11-08-04 11:24 AM\
I think most importantly i need the UA code\
11-08-04 11:24 AM\
it's something that google analytics generate\
11-08-04 11:24 AM\
if you have the account\
11-08-04 11:24 AM\
as in the google anatlytics account, it should provide a UA\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:24 AM \
where is it generated?\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:25 AM \
It should be generated with the Google Analytic website itself\
11-08-04 11:25 AM\
when you provide your company info to them\
11-08-04 11:25 AM\
and the website info\
11-08-04 11:25 AM\
for them to track\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:25 AM \
it seems to be asking for an account profile\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:25 AM \
yes.\
11-08-04 11:25 AM\
and currently you don't seem to have one\
11-08-04 11:26 AM\
on my computer it's asking for my profile from capilano, which is something you don't want me to put in\
11-08-04 11:26 AM\
can you select the Create New Account\
11-08-04 11:26 AM\
to see if it'll automatically generate a UA code for you, which is under Profile\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:26 AM \
ok\
11-08-04 11:27 AM\
it brings up interactive design lab?\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:27 AM \
yeah, that's my Capilano UA code, which is incorrect\
11-08-04 11:27 AM\
because that links to my school\
11-08-04 11:28 AM\
for some weird reason that went in to my school account\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:28 AM \
where would i generate a UA code?\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:29 AM \
in your own Google Analytic profile\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:29 AM \
k -already on it here\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:29 AM \
you'll have to go to the website and set it up\
11-08-04 11:29 AM\
like flickr and other websites\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:30 AM \
so many accounts ;p\

hmm give me a sec here\
11-08-04 11:31 AM\
ok i think i got it\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:32 AM \
good good \
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:32 AM \
thank you. so you guys do have a google analytics\
11-08-04 11:32 AM\
and it's all set up using your google account?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:33 AM \
?\
11-08-04 11:34 AM\
not sure when it would have been done\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 11:34 AM \
kk, i'll figure it out and fill out the information in the analytics \
11-08-04 11:34 AM\
thanks again!\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 11:34 AM \

Carol Chan 11-08-04 2:08 PM \

11-08-04 2:08 PM\
You can give me some by monday\
11-08-04 2:08 PM\
for me to code them in\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 2:09 PM \
i don't think it's likely all would be ready\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 2:09 PM \
by definitely i will need them all by next friday\
11-08-04 2:09 PM\
You can give me what you can by monday...say 20?\
11-08-04 2:09 PM\
and hopefully we can work something out\
11-08-04 2:09 PM\
i can try to work on other things\
11-08-04 2:10 PM\
hopefully keith has the wordpress update done by then so i could work on that, which will give you some time to edit photos?\

Is it ok I change the profile pic for Callaghan Country's Facebook page?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 5:01 PM \
what did you want to change it to?\
11-08-04 5:01 PM\
sure\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 5:01 PM \
Into Callaghan Country Logo?\
11-08-04 5:01 PM\
is that ok?\
11-08-04 5:02 PM\
because it'd be a lot catchy\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 5:03 PM \
yep - the reason i started with a photo of the lodge was because i knew some users would be migrating from the Ski Callaghan page (WOP) and i wanted to make it less confusing for them\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 5:03 PM \
icic.\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 5:03 PM \
i did plan to switch over to the logo eventually so no problem if you want to do that now\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 5:04 PM \
sure, i'm just gonna upload 4 more photos, that way it'll show up on the top as well.\
Kim Ebers 11-08-04 5:04 PM \
i'll be adding photos soon, but it's not a top priority at the moment\
11-08-04 5:04 PM\
coolio - thanks!\
11-08-04 5:07 PM\
oh, the logo needs to be narrowed to fit the wierd facebook format for posts\

it's "merge visible" to compress the layers before saving web ready export file?\
Carol Chan 11-08-04 5:31 PM \
yes, you may want to create a copy that is not merged that way if you want to make changes, you'll have that copy. Once merged, you can't go back once u've close photoshop.\

Hi Carol\
11-08-16 1:51 PM\
quick question re: content for wordpress pages\
11-08-16 1:52 PM\
is it possible to add un-published notes to each page?\
11-08-17 8:51 AM\
Hi Carol,\
11-08-17 8:51 AM\
We do have a LinkedIn account now\
11-08-17 8:51 AM\
not sure what you will need for the "share" button discussed in the wireframes\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 9:59 AM \
Hi Kim\
11-08-18 9:59 AM\
I think you will need to have linkedin account and also an ShareThis account created\
11-08-18 9:59 AM\
to keep track of the ppl clicking it\
11-08-18 10:00 AM\
I'm trying to have linkedin placed on the particular pages but i'm finding it very difficult localizing it\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:00 AM \
I did set up a linkedin company profile\
11-08-18 10:02 AM\
so i need to register with ShareThis?\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:02 AM \
something is weird with linkedin. it should lead you to their home page.\
11-08-18 10:02 AM\
Yes you need to have ShareThis account\
11-08-18 10:03 AM\
so you can keep track of how many ppl click on your website\
11-08-18 10:03 AM\
it's optional\
11-08-18 10:03 AM\
but it helps to know who and what clicked\
11-08-18 10:03 AM\
plus you can tie ShareThis to the Google Analytics that is already set up as well\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:03 AM \
ok will do\

what's still needed with linked in?\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:05 AM \
it's working fine now\
11-08-18 10:05 AM\
i think their server on their end wasn't working\
11-08-18 10:05 AM\
i can post stuff with my linkedin account\
11-08-18 10:05 AM\
try again\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:05 AM \
try what?\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:05 AM \
clicking linkedin and signin\
11-08-18 10:06 AM\
You were asking earlier about your linkedin account?\
11-08-18 10:06 AM\
And if it works?\
11-08-18 10:06 AM\
I tried it just now clicking it and signing in\
11-08-18 10:06 AM\
it works\
11-08-18 10:07 AM\
it's just a great way to join your webpage\
11-08-18 10:07 AM\
just like facebook\
11-08-18 10:07 AM\
where i have Callaghan Country on my wall\
11-08-18 10:07 AM\
when i click like and signed in\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:08 AM \
i see\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:08 AM \
I have a question for you since I have you online\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:08 AM \
sure\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:09 AM \
Do you mind having the linkedin appear in all pages? Again, as i mentioned. I'm having difficult time trying to localize it to just the volunteer, employment, company info and teambuilding page\
11-08-18 10:09 AM\
I'll try my best to have it stick to those pages only\
11-08-18 10:10 AM\
in the meantime, it seems a little tough with the template in place for it to show up all pages\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:10 AM \
i don't see it as a big deal - if it's eating up too much time just move on to the next task\
11-08-18 10:10 AM\
i also had a couple questions...\
11-08-18 10:10 AM\
still having issues with Wpacking2\
11-08-18 10:11 AM\
looks like it's labelled correctly, but stilll not working\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:12 AM \
let me take a look\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:16 AM \
I just registered a ShareThis account\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:16 AM \
Hi, check if the photo is showing up now on your end?\
11-08-18 10:17 AM\
it should show up now.\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:17 AM \
yep - what was the issue?\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:18 AM \
it was just the coding that was a little mess up from the previous coding that conflicted\
11-08-18 10:18 AM\
it's not something you can fix\
11-08-18 10:18 AM\
which is why it's good to upload the photos to see if there's any errors\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:18 AM \
i don't follow\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:19 AM \
it's something from my end that I will have to fix\
11-08-18 10:19 AM\
it's nothing you can do on your end\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:19 AM \
but you finish in less than two weeks\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:19 AM \
you're doing a great job labeling it correctly\
11-08-18 10:19 AM\
finish what?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:19 AM \
i really need to be able to understand this type of trouble shooting\
11-08-18 10:19 AM\
at least conceptually\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:20 AM \
it's within the php files\
11-08-18 10:20 AM\
it's not entirely finished\
11-08-18 10:20 AM\
there are always gliches\
11-08-18 10:20 AM\
such as the one you saw today\
11-08-18 10:20 AM\
and the one you see with webrez\
11-08-18 10:20 AM\
implementing may seem easy\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:20 AM \
ok - so in the future who would you suggest i contact if something like this happens?\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:20 AM \
but having them all work in harmony is another thing\
11-08-18 10:21 AM\
Yes, contact me if something minor like this happens\
11-08-18 10:21 AM\
But I do hope that we finish the photo uploading before I leave\
11-08-18 10:21 AM\
that way I can catch any gliches from happening\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:21 AM \
ok sounds good\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:21 AM \
\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:22 AM \
i would also like to start uploading other media content such as pdf documents, but not sure how to inlude it on the page\
11-08-18 10:22 AM\
ex FAQ\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:22 AM \
let me check the wireframe to refresh my memory hold sec\
11-08-18 10:23 AM\
Oh wait, the FAQ is just a link to the pdf?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:24 AM \
well there are 2 different docs: both summer and winter\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:25 AM \
ok\
11-08-18 10:25 AM\
i see the summer is up\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:26 AM \
yes - i need to take another look at the winter one before putting it up\
11-08-18 10:26 AM\
there's still alot of details about our winter product that are up in the air\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:27 AM \
so your questions is how to upload the FAQ?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:28 AM \
i would like to upload the packing lists as "view printable pdf" link aswell\
11-08-18 10:28 AM\
i have uploaded but i don't know how to post to a page\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 10:29 AM \
same as what you did with the Summer FAQ\
11-08-18 10:29 AM\
you upload it to the media library in WP\
11-08-18 10:29 AM\
then copy the link and paste it in the content\
11-08-18 10:29 AM\
I'm not entirely understanding your question?\
11-08-18 10:30 AM\
Are you talking about the layout?\
11-08-18 10:30 AM\
or the technicalities\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 10:30 AM \
could we do screen sharing?\
11-08-18 10:31 AM\

Hi Kim\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 12:35 PM \
Hi\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 12:36 PM \
I have the copy pasted already. For the FAQ\
11-08-18 12:36 PM\
So it would take approx. couple hours\
11-08-18 12:36 PM\
I will leave it to the last minute\
11-08-18 12:36 PM\
if need to be\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 12:36 PM \
yep - i think that's best for now\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 12:36 PM \
I didn't realize how long the FAQs are\
11-08-18 12:37 PM\
eventually, it would be feasible to have it anchored\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 12:37 PM \
i'd be more confident working on the anchors once all the community pages are done and I have a better grasp on content\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 12:37 PM \
sounds good \
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 12:38 PM \
good stuff!\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 12:38 PM \
but do email me the Winter FAQ\
11-08-18 12:38 PM\
that way I have all of the information with me\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 12:39 PM \
sure- as i said, it may need some updating from last season so give me a couple days\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 12:39 PM \
ok sounds good. ttyl \
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 12:39 PM \
ciao \
Carol Chan 11-08-18 1:13 PM \
Hi Kim, FYI the image carousel is currently not working\
11-08-18 1:13 PM\
I've emailed Keith about it and cc it to you\
11-08-18 1:13 PM\
It seems the update breaks it\
11-08-18 1:13 PM\
Hopefully Keith could do something about it\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 1:14 PM \
what update?\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 1:14 PM \
wordpress will asks for update\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 1:14 PM \
ic ic\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 1:15 PM \
and it's helpful to know in the future too\
11-08-18 1:15 PM\
becaouse\
11-08-18 1:15 PM\
there are always the latest firefox or safari update\
11-08-18 1:15 PM\
for Browsers\
11-08-18 1:15 PM\
hence, you may want to update your plugins from time to time\
11-08-18 1:15 PM\
that way it's compatible to the latest browser\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 1:16 PM \
would there be info about this from wordpress itself?\
11-08-18 1:16 PM\
i'm thinking this might not be Keith's area of expertise\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 1:16 PM \
well i did check\
11-08-18 1:17 PM\
and it says that it's either the jQuery code that's conflicting\
11-08-18 1:17 PM\
or the custom images\
11-08-18 1:17 PM\
i checked both\
11-08-18 1:17 PM\
and there is no issue\
11-08-18 1:17 PM\
i turned off the jQuery code just in case it conflicts\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 1:17 PM \
ok let's wait and see then\
Carol Chan 11-08-18 1:17 PM \
Yeah, I'm curious if it has anything to do with the php update he made?\
11-08-18 1:45 PM\
Nvm, the problem is now fixed  Sorry for any unecessary alertness!\
Kim Ebers 11-08-18 1:46 PM \

did u receive my invite from linkedin on providing me a recommendattion?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-23 12:15 PM \
I did...Brad has asked me to hold off until we finish the project...hope that's ok\
Carol Chan 11-08-23 12:15 PM \
ok sounds good \
Kim Ebers 11-08-23 12:16 PM \
once everything is complete, we'd also be happy to include a link from the freinds and partners page aswell\
11-08-23 12:17 PM\
i just sent the email for the skwez info\
11-08-23 12:17 PM\
code was pulled from...http://skwez.com/partners.html\
Carol Chan 11-08-23 12:27 PM \
ok got it.\
11-08-23 12:28 PM\
Hey, may I also request a reference letter too?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-23 12:51 PM \
Yep, agian after completion of the project we are very happy to put together a recoomendation package, just need approval from Brad which requires the fully functional website
\b0 \
Carol Chan 11-08-23 1:03 PM \
Sounds good \
11-08-23 1:06 PM\
Once last thing, have you and Brad decided yet on whether to include the Greyhound services?\
11-08-23 1:06 PM\
"Note: The bus stops at a certain location within Squamish. It does not stop at the Callaghan Country\
lodge. Please refer to our ride share Skwez for more information on getting here."\
11-08-23 1:07 PM\
"For more detailed information please check out: http://www.greyhound.ca/home/"\
Kim Ebers 11-08-23 1:08 PM \
I think it would be best to leave that out for now - I have a felling it would lead to complaints and rediculous questions here on my end\
Carol Chan 11-08-23 1:09 PM \
ok, sounds good.\
11-08-23 2:22 PM\
Hi Kim, I can't find the code for the Skwez widget. Can you possibly send it again? thankx\
Kim Ebers 11-08-23 2:22 PM \
yep - just a sec\

I just pulled that from http://www.callaghancountry.com/trailhead/gettinghere.php\
11-08-23 2:26 PM\
but I also sent the original code that Manuel sent me when we first set it up on the site\
11-08-23 2:26 PM\
feel free to contact manuel directly - he's super helpful\
Carol Chan 11-08-23 2:47 PM \
sounds good\
Kim Ebers 11-08-23 2:47 PM \
do you think the original code will work?\
Carol Chan 11-08-23 2:48 PM \
i have to test it out and see\
11-08-23 2:48 PM\
if not i will have to ask manuel? who is he?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-23 2:49 PM \
He's a Squamish local - when we originally added it to the site, I met in person with Manuel and he fine-tuned the code so it would work within the page for us -he's one of the skwez founders\
Carol Chan 11-08-23 2:50 PM \
is there an iframe or script that i could plunk in like the one from web rez?\

Oh wait, nvm.\
11-08-23 3:00 PM\
This is in the Getting Connected page.\
11-08-23 3:00 PM\
ignore that link\
Kim Ebers 11-08-23 3:01 PM \
no worries - size wise though maybe just a 1/4 of what is previewed there\
11-08-23 3:01 PM\
whatever works within the rest of the design\
Carol Chan 11-08-23 3:01 PM \
also, manuel email said that this link: http://skwez.com/partners/callaghan-valley.html\
11-08-23 3:01 PM\
prepares to designated area?\
11-08-23 3:01 PM\
should i ignore that?\
11-08-23 3:02 PM\
cuz it's a dead link...i'm assuming it's just a temp. preview\

Hi, I'm dong the newsletter archive widget\
11-08-23 8:41 PM\

11-08-23 8:41 PM\
There's teh Ski Club Newsletter List\
11-08-23 8:42 PM\
Callaghan Country Newsletter?\
11-08-23 8:42 PM\
Season passholder\
Kim Ebers 11-08-23 8:42 PM \
Yep i saw the request for api key\
Carol Chan 11-08-23 8:42 PM \
there's so many\
Kim Ebers 11-08-23 8:43 PM \
i know - that's another major to-do...mailchimp updated their lists capabilities almost a month or two after the old marketing person left\
11-08-23 8:43 PM\
so i do need to combine them all\
11-08-23 8:43 PM\
let me take a look\
11-08-23 8:43 PM\
there is one that i will be merging them all into soon\
Carol Chan 11-08-23 8:43 PM \
currently on wordpress there are options\
11-08-23 8:43 PM\
i could try to see if i could merge them all into wordpress?\
11-08-23 8:43 PM\
i can't guarantee anything\
11-08-23 8:44 PM\
but there's an option that says check all\
11-08-23 8:44 PM\
so i'll check it to select all of the archived newsletter\
11-08-23 8:44 PM\
but i'm not sure how it's gonna turn out\
Kim Ebers 11-08-23 8:44 PM \

Carol Chan 11-08-24 3:11 PM \
Hi Kim\
Kim Ebers 11-08-24 3:12 PM \
I don't think I recieved your timesheet from last payperiod (ending Aug20)\
Carol Chan 11-08-24 3:13 PM \
i had that week off so i wasn't sure if u still want me to email it to you? I thought i'd sent it for the weeks i've worked?\
11-08-24 3:13 PM\
did you want me to email it to you any way?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-24 3:15 PM \
just a sec\
11-08-24 3:27 PM\
back - sorry reservation inquiry on the phone \
Carol Chan 11-08-24 3:27 PM \
no worries\
Kim Ebers 11-08-24 3:27 PM \
yes, I believe you worked on the first week of that pay period?\
Carol Chan 11-08-24 3:28 PM \
remember keith's upgrade\
11-08-24 3:28 PM\
we both decided that i'd take that week off\
11-08-24 3:28 PM\
aug 7-13\
11-08-24 3:29 PM\
i didn't start working util 15th of august\
Kim Ebers 11-08-24 3:29 PM \
but the pay period covers Aug7-20\
Carol Chan 11-08-24 3:29 PM \
ok, so i should email you the days that it's off as well?\
11-08-24 3:29 PM\
sounds good to me\
Kim Ebers 11-08-24 3:29 PM \
yep\
Carol Chan 11-08-24 3:30 PM \
Ok, I'll modify it back to the original. In the meantime, can i get the excel spreadsheet for this week?\
11-08-24 3:30 PM\
thanks! \
Kim Ebers 11-08-24 3:31 PM \
sure i'll update it and fwd to you in a wee bit\
Carol Chan 11-08-25 9:36 AM \
Morning Kim, I'm was wondering do you have the excel timesheet for this week?\
11-08-25 9:36 AM\
I sent the aug 7 - 20th yesterday. I hoped you received it?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-25 9:36 AM \
Not yet - Sorry Carol, I've had quite a few other tasks to deal with\
Carol Chan 11-08-25 9:37 AM \
ok, should i just revise the aug 7 - 20  into Aug 21-27 for you? \
11-08-25 9:38 AM\
i can just plunk in the numbers\
Kim Ebers 11-08-25 9:38 AM \
yep - i usually make a copy of the sheet and then just edit the dates\
11-08-25 9:38 AM\
that way your entire work record is within the same document\
Carol Chan 11-08-25 9:40 AM \
sounds good\
Kim Ebers 11-08-26 3:50 PM \
Hi Carol\
Carol Chan 11-08-26 4:45 PM \
Hi Kim, what can i do for you?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 11:01 AM \
Hi Carol\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 11:17 AM \
Hi Kim\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 11:17 AM \
I think there was some confusion about switching on the website immediately\
11-08-30 11:18 AM\
we had discussed that we wouldn't actually be ready to do that until after labour day\
11-08-30 11:18 AM\
right now i have no record of our old site\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 11:18 AM \
ok, but if you want to remove the /wordpress / then it'll have to wait until then\
11-08-30 11:18 AM\
and have Keith to do it?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 11:18 AM \
and this is extremely un-nerving from the business perspective\\\
11-08-30 11:19 AM\
the site is not ready for perspective guests to view\

HI kIm\
11-08-30 11:29 AM\
Just so we're clear\
11-08-30 11:29 AM\
Once we switch it back to the old website\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 11:31 AM \
?\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 11:31 AM \
i'm not going to be around to run it live\
11-08-30 11:31 AM\
because you want it after labour day?\
11-08-30 11:31 AM\
it's a lot of work to do the switch over\
11-08-30 11:31 AM\
so i just want to make sure\
11-08-30 11:32 AM\
that you will be working that out with Keith\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 11:33 AM \
I'm not too sure what to say Carol\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 11:33 AM \
I'm trying to contact Keith\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 11:34 AM \
It seems as though you are the only one who knows the inns and outs of the details required for a smooth switch over\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 11:34 AM \
it's not picking up or i'm not dialing the right number\
11-08-30 11:34 AM\
but before I have him on the line\
11-08-30 11:34 AM\
I do need a general consensus\
11-08-30 11:34 AM\
because this took me the whole day to do the switch over\

Hi Carol - just saw the email from Keith\
11-08-30 12:01 PM\
Looks like he's got the right idea\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:01 PM \
I just got off the phone with him\
11-08-30 12:02 PM\
He's switching it right now as we speak\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 12:02 PM \
phwewf!\
11-08-30 12:03 PM\
wish i knew how to spell that sound effect\
11-08-30 12:03 PM\
\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:03 PM \
hahaha sorry about the confusion\
11-08-30 12:03 PM\
Lol\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 12:03 PM \
it was supposed to be a revlieved sigh\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:03 PM \
I spoke with Keith\
11-08-30 12:03 PM\
I believe he will be doing the switch over once you gave him the ok to do so.\
11-08-30 12:04 PM\
I think he's setting it up tonight in advance with what he just wrote in the email\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 12:04 PM \
sounds great\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:04 PM \
so that once u are good. it's all preset up\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 12:04 PM \
and he's switching back to our old website for public visibilty?\
11-08-30 12:06 PM\
also, i will need to know the admin sign in so i can keep updating content\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:08 PM \
yes he's switching it back\
11-08-30 12:08 PM\
admin\
11-08-30 12:08 PM\
xt8yg#iK\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 12:09 PM \
that will work again once he's done the switch?\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:09 PM \
it's working now for me\
11-08-30 12:09 PM\
you may have to clear your cache and cookies\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 12:10 PM \
i don't know how to do that\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:10 PM \
firefox - tools > web developer > miscellanous > clear data > cache and history\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 12:12 PM \
i don't get the same file path\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:17 PM \
tools > clear recent history?\
11-08-30 12:17 PM\
i'm not too sure which firefox you have\
11-08-30 12:18 PM\
you may have to download a plugin called web developer\
11-08-30 12:18 PM\
tool kit\
11-08-30 12:18 PM\
it'll direct you to the file path above\
11-08-30 12:18 PM\
and it makes it a lot easier to work in the future\
11-08-30 12:18 PM\
if not, you can just shift + click refresh\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 12:19 PM \
i'm still not able to acces the sign in screen\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:23 PM \
Keith is working on it\
11-08-30 12:24 PM\
i just changed it back to callaghancountry.com/wordpress\
11-08-30 12:24 PM\
i added the wordpress in there\
11-08-30 12:24 PM\
that way you have access to it\
11-08-30 12:24 PM\
earlier this morning it was callaghancountry.com/wp-login.php\
11-08-30 12:25 PM\
the old website is up live\
11-08-30 12:25 PM\
Keith is now configuring the new one\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 12:25 PM \
good news\
11-08-30 12:25 PM\
did you still need the facebook api info?\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:26 PM \
no i think i'm good.\
11-08-30 12:26 PM\
\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 12:26 PM \
ok\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:27 PM \
I gotta go, I'll send you the package later today?\
11-08-30 12:27 PM\
Do you have any other questions for me in the meantime?\
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 12:27 PM \
yep that will be fine\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 12:27 PM \
ok ttyl! \
Kim Ebers 11-08-30 3:29 PM \
Hi Carol\
11-08-30 3:29 PM\
You still need to email Sharon your corrected timesheet\
Carol Chan 11-08-30 5:05 PM \
Oh right! Thanks for the reminder, completely forgot.\
9:45 AM\
Good morning Kim\
9:45 AM\
It's my last day today!\
9:45 AM\
\
9:46 AM\
Is there anything that needs to be done or something that we're missing?\
Kim Ebers 9:46 AM \
so you still need the summer faq?\
Carol Chan 9:46 AM \
Yes I do.\
Kim Ebers\
\
\
Ok sounds good. We'll catch up at 11:30 then. Before I forget, just a reminder about my reference letter?\
9:53 AM\
Has Brad decided when I'll be receiving it?\
Kim Ebers 9:54 AM \
again - Brad isn't ready to send one off until the project is completely done\
9:54 AM\
not just you finishing\
Carol Chan 9:54 AM \
what else can i do on my part then?\
9:54 AM\
I think, all i have is the FAQ and the pkg?\
9:54 AM\
the rest is pretty much passed off to Keith\
Kim Ebers 9:54 AM \
i think that may be it\
Carol Chan 9:55 AM \
as in having it run live\
Kim Ebers 9:55 AM \
are you still referring to the reference letter?\
Carol Chan 9:56 AM \
yep and the linkedin as well. But i could always upload the reference letter into linkedin \
Kim Ebers 9:56 AM \
since this has been a team project you will receive a reference when the whole team has completed a project\
9:56 AM\
if that makes sense\
9:57 AM\
it's tough to write a reference unless we see a great end piece\
Carol Chan 9:57 AM \
It doesn't make sense, you said that my work is pretty much done\
Kim Ebers 9:58 AM \
Carol - i will have to discuss this with you later\
Carol Chan 9:58 AM \
well, what you see online is the end piece no?\
9:59 AM\
sure, what time?\
10:01 AM\
Because I'm hoping we can discuss this on the phone via from Skype.\
Kim Ebers 10:03 AM \
i will be back in around 11:30 or 12\
Carol Chan 10:04 AM \
Sounds good. I'll chat with you then because I'm not sure why is there such difficulty. Unless there is something you and Brad are displeased about, which I hope you can be honest that way I can improve on it in the future.\
10:04 AM\
Talk to you later.}
